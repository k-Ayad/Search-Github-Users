# GitHub User Search Angular App

This Angular application provides a user-friendly search feature for GitHub users. It uses Angular, RxJS for handling asynchronous operations, NgRx for managing application state, and Jasmine framework for unit testing.

## Features

- **User Search**: Users can search for GitHub users by entering a search term in the provided input field.

- **Asynchronous Operations**: The application handles asynchronous operations, such as making API requests to the GitHub API, using RxJS observables.

- **Application State Management**: NgRx is used for managing the application state, making it easy to handle complex data flow and state changes.

- **Unit Testing**: The project is set up for unit testing using the Jasmine testing framework, ensuring code quality and reliability.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: The application is built using Angular, a popular front-end framework.

- **RxJS**: RxJS is used to manage asynchronous operations, such as making API requests and handling user input.

- **NgRx**: NgRx is employed to manage the application state, making it easier to handle data flow and updates.

- **Jasmine**: Jasmine is used for unit testing to ensure the correctness and reliability of the codebase.
